## Core Principles: <a name="core-principles" id="core-principles"></a> 

These core principles are to be followed and practiced in all aspects of the ecosystem. In every single micro-action, decision making, comparison and crisis management, these principles must be honored in the  following order.

- Privacy. [Ecosystem](/req.md#ecosystem) and the [Master](/req.md#master) shall remain anonymous and concealed. 
- Security. [Ecosystem](/req.md#ecosystem) must use every module at it's disposal to protect itself againist foreign entities. This includes preemptive [counter-measures](/counter-measures.md).
- Independency. Services, test subjects, objects and items are to be preferred to be local if given option. System should be kept as independent as possible. Dependency includes both physical (e.g: electricity) and virtual (e.g: composer, npm, apt packages. Or external API's).



## Primary objectives of the system ordered by priority:
1. Data that originates or resides from the bounds of the [ecosystem](/req.md#ecosystem) shall remain inside ecosystem at all cost. In case of a breach risk, compromise or remote/physical intervention: system may choose to eradicate the data as a whole in order to maintain privacy and security.
2. [Master](/req.md#master) has the absolute authority over the ecosystem and shall override rules, objectives and actions as necessary. This objective applies to all other objectives after number 2.
3. In case of an emergency or catastrophic events as described in [Action Plan](/action-plan.md), the priority of entities are:
      - Ecosystem data
      - FIN protocol integrity and requiremenents at ready for execution
      - [Master](/req.md#master)
      - Other ecosystem users
      - Other ecosystem modules

4. At no time any user of the ecosystem (except Master) shall act againist ecosystem as a whole or partially. Integrity and consistency of the system must remain tip-top.
